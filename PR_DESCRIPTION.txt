Title: Initial commit — Product Catalog React training project

Description:

This PR adds the initial project files for a small React training project. The app demonstrates key React fundamentals:

- Components, props, and JSX
- `useState` for local state management
- `useEffect` for data fetching and handling side effects
- Suggestion to refactor the data fetching logic into a custom hook (e.g., `useFetch`)

Notes:
- Data is loaded from the Fake Store API for demo purposes.
- This project is intended for learning and experimentation, not production use.
